## Purpose of Project
The purpose of this project was an analysis of New York Citi Bike Data by using Tableau, a data visualization tool. Through Tableau we were able to show a variety of graphs, maps, heat charts, etc. to get a better understanding of the Citi Bike data. With this understanding, we explored the option of a similar bike-sharing business in Des Moines.
