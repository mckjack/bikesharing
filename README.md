## Purpose of Project
The purpose of this project was an analysis of New York Citi Bike Data by using Tableau, a data visualization tool. Through Tableau we were able to show a variety of graphs, maps, heat charts, etc. to get a better understanding of the Citi Bike data. With this understanding, we explored the option of a similar bike-sharing business in Des Moines. 
## Results

#### August 2019 Visualizations

 - Top ride starting points are in areas that are busy and attract a lot of tourism.
 - More of the user base are subscribers and male.
 - Younger users tend to go on longer rides since they use the service for a higher duration.
 #### August Peak Hours

 - Bike maintenance is good from 2 AM to 5 AM since this is the lowest bike activity.
 - 5 PM to 7PM are the busiest times for the service

 - Rides during the week are during commuter hours of 7AM to 9AM and 5PM to 7pm
 - Most males are biking during these times
 - Weekend volume is much lower than weekday but have steady average from 10AM to 7PM

 - On average bikes are in service to the rider for roughly 4-6 hours.
 - Male riders take 3x more rides than females.
## Summary
We see through the data that the highest activity is during the commuter time of 7AM to 9AM and 5PM to 7PM on weekdays. This can infer that the Citi Bikes are being used for a mode of transportation for workers in the downtown core of the city. We can also see that there was a high volume of over 2.3 million rides in the month of August alone. Additional analysis to further adapt this idea in Des Moines, Iowa would be to look at the weather and how that affects the ride count. Another connection could be made to see how the data for Citi Bike transfers over a whole year so we can see when bike ride volume is at its highest and lowest.
